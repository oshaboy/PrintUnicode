# PrintUnicode
 A few python scripts that take an image and outputs them to the console as unicode

type use the "-h" command line option for instructions because I am too lazy to put them all here. 

I may add scripts for the "Symbols for Legacy Computing" once Unicode 13 rolls out. 

# What all the scripts do?


printBlock.py - uses shaded Block Element (5 shades, 1 pixel per char)  
printBlock13Shade.py - uses shaded Block Elements and ANSI escape codes for Black, Dark Grey, Light Grey and White (13 shades, 1 pixel per char)  
printBlockAnsi.py - uses shaded Block Elements and ANSI escape codes to give hue (10 shades, 16 hues, 1 pixel per char)  
printBraille.py - uses Braille (2 shades, 6/8 pixel per char)  
printQuad.py - uses Block Elements of Quadrants (2 shades, 4 pixel per char)
printWhatev.py - 1bpp with whatever char you pick (Default: â¬¤) (2 shades, 4 pixel per char)
