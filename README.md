# PrintUnicode
 A few python scripts that take an image and outputs them to the console as unicode

type use the "-h" command line option for instructions because I am too lazy to put them all here. 

I may add scripts for the "Symbols for Legacy Computing" one Unicode 13 rolls out. 
### Usage
print*.py image [-h] [-d] [-t #n] [-i]
